.SS GET_KEYSTROKE ACTION
.PP
Convenient scripting function that waits for and returns the
contents of a single keystroke.
.PP
The function reliably returns exactly one keystroke string per call,
whether it is a singleton or a string of printable or non-printable
characters.
.PP
The function prevents the keystroke from disturbing the screen,
neither echoing the character nor allowing the cursor to move.

.BI "-v " variable_name
