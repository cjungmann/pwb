.SS DECLARE ACTION
.PP
The
.B declare
action creates a PWB handle.
The handle holds information necessary to present and manage an
activate scrolling display.
.PP
.pt_declare
.RS
.TP
.I new_handle_name
Name to use for the new handle
.TP
.I data_source_name
Name of a data source.
This could be an array or an
.B ate
table.
The
.B data_source_name
will be passed to the callback functions to use however deemed
necessary by the developer.
For arrays, use:
.IP
.EX
local -n locDS=\(dq$data_source_name\(dq
.EE
.TP
.I data_count
should be the number of elements in the
.BR data_source .
This might be redundant for an array
.BR data_source ,
but other data sources may not provide this information, or the
information might be expensive to acquire.
.TP
.I printer_func_name
is a required argument, and refers to a script function that should
be called to print each line.  See the
.B PRINT FUNCTION
section elsewhere in this document.
.TP
.B -h
This parameter-less argument disables automatic line highlighting.
Normally,
.B pwb
will enable simple highlighting, as appropriate, before calling the
printer function.
Disable line highlighting with the
.B -h
option if the developer wants more control over highlighting.
.TP
.BI "-d " extra_data_name
is a name that will be passed to the callback functions to be used
as an extra resource for rendering lines or executing a command.
Like the
.B data_source
argument, this is only a name.
The name can be a handle name or an array name, or something else
entirely.
The developer must determine the best way to access the data.
.TP
.BI "-e " exec_func_name
Is an optional function to be called whenever a mapped key is
clicked (see the
.B KEYMAP
section elsewhere in this document).
.TP
.BI "-b " bottom_margin_print_function
Optional bottom margin print function name.  If the
.B set_margins
action established a bottom margin, this script function
will be called by
.B pwb
to print the contents of the bottom margin.
It will be called for a full screen plot and with each selection
change so the contents of the margin can reflect the current
selection.
.TP
.BI "-l " left_margin_print_function
like the
.I bottom_margin_print_function
described above, this callback function will be responsible for
populating the left margin (if established) according to the
currently selected data item.
.TP
.BI "-r " right_margin_print_function
like the
.I bottom_margin_print_function
described above, this callback function will be responsible for
populating the right margin (if established) according to the
currently selected data item.
.TP
.BI "-t " top_margin_print_function
like the
.I bottom_margin_print_function
described above, this callback function will be responsible for
populating the top margin (if established) according to the
currently selected data item.
