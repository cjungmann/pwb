.SS PRINTING ACTIONS

Actions
.BR measure_string " and " limit_print
do not count CSI sequences when measuring or printing their
strings.
Residing in an API for a line-printing control, they make no attempt
to interpret the CSI sequences, and can thus be confused by
cursor-moving CSI sequences.
Please refrain from including these types of CSI sequences in strings
that will be processed by these actions.
.TP
.B IMPORTANT NOTE ON \(dq--\(dq
Argument processing assumes any string beginning with a
.RB \(dq - \(dq
is an option.
To ensure a string with a leading
.RB \(dq - \(dq
is
.I not
treated as an option, include a
.RB \(dq -- \(dq
argument before the string argument (but after the optional
.BI "-v " variable_name
argument) to signal all following arguments are strings.

Here are some examples of safe invocations of
.BR "pwb measure_string" " and " "pwb limit_print" :
.IP
.RS 11
.EX
pwb measure_string -- \(dq\(Dostr\(dq
pwb measure_string -v varname -- \(dq\(Dostr\(dq
pwb limit_string 12 -- \(dq\(Dostr\(dq

.SS MEASURE_STRING
.PP
Strings that include escaped CSI codes will print shorter than the
number of characters in the string.
This function parses the string to predict its screen-printed length.
.PP
The printed length will be found in a variable named
.BR PWB_VALUE ,
unless the reporting variable is changed with the
.B -v
option.
.PP
.pt_measure_string
.RS
.TP
.BI -v " variable_name"
Optional name of variable to which the result will be reported.
.TP
.B --
Optional value signalling that remaining arguments are not options.
.TP
.I string
The string to be measured.
.RE
.PP
Use
.B measure_string
for centering text or other algorithms that need the visible length
of a string.
.SS LIMIT_PRINT
.PP
Use this function to print a string containing CSI color codes
within a constrained number of screen columns.
.PP
.pt_limit_print
.RS
.TP
.I length
The maximum number of screen characters to be printed.
.TP
.B --
Optional value signalling that remaining arguments are not options.
.TP
.I string
The string to be printed.
.RE
.PP
Use this function to prevent a string from printing past its
boundaries.
