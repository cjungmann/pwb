.SS PRINTING ACTIONS
.PP
Actions
.BR measure_string " and " limit_print
do not count CSI sequences when measuring or printing their
strings.
Residing in an API for a line-printing control, they make no attempt
to interpret the CSI sequences, and can thus be confused by
cursor-moving CSI sequences.
Please refrain from including these types of CSI sequences in strings
that will be processed by these actions.
.SS MEASURE_STRING
.PP
Strings that include escaped CSI codes will print shorter than the
number of characters in the string.
This function parses the string to predict its screen-printed length.
.PP
The printed length will be found in a variable named
.BR PWB_VALUE ,
unless the reporting variable is changed with the
.B -v
option.
.PP
.pt_measure_string
.RS
.TP
.BI -v " variable_name"
Optional name of variable to which the result will be reported.
.TP
.I string
The string to be measured.
.RE
.PP
Use
.B measure_string
for centering text or other algorithms that need the visible length
of a string.
.SS LIMIT_PRINT
.PP
Use this function to print a string containing CSI color codes
within a constrained number of screen columns.
.PP
.pt_limit_print
.RS
.TP
.I length
The maximum number of screen characters to be printed.
.TP
.I string
The string to be printed.
.RE
.PP
Use this function to prevent a string from printing past its
boundaries.
